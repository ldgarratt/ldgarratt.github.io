<p>It is well known among cryptographers that ECB mode is insecure. The most famous demonstration of this is the ECB penguin:</p>

<p>It has a certain <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Marilyn+Monroe+by+Andy+Warhol&amp;tbm=isch">Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe</a> vibe to it.</p>

<p>ECB art is nothing new: the ECB penguin has been on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_(ECB)">Wikipedia</a> since 2004. Filippo—who is wicked smart and I was very fortunate to work with him briefly in Oxford—made a popular <a href="https://words.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/">blog post</a> about it in 2013, so I won’t rehash it here. But I couldn’t find a simple script which automates the process, so I <a href="https://github.com/ldgarratt/ecb_art">made one</a>. Note: it only works well with images with repeating patterns such as simple digital images lacking a rich colour palette.</p>
