It is well known among cryptographers that ECB mode is insecure. The most famous demonstration of this is the ECB penguin:

It has a certain [Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe](https://www.google.com/search?q=Marilyn+Monroe+by+Andy+Warhol&tbm=isch) vibe to it.

ECB art is nothing new: the ECB penguin has been on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_(ECB)) since 2004. Filippo---who is wicked smart and I was very fortunate to work with him briefly in Oxford---made a popular [blog post](https://words.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/) about it in 2013, so I won't rehash it here. But I couldn't find a simple script which automates the process, so I [made one](https://github.com/ldgarratt/ecb_art). Note: it only works well with images with repeating patterns such as simple digital images lacking a rich colour palette.
